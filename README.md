# Book Recommendation App - Find Your Next Read
This app is for all the people that do not know what book they want to read this time.

In this app you can search for a book using a variety of filter options, then in the results you can sort either on title, author, page number or rating.
The information on the books are from the goodreads site (goodreads.com).

There are two different databases to search through, a self-made small, but complete database, and a very large but incomplete database.

The app is still a work in progress. What I also want to implement is the ability for users of Goodreads to login and search through their own to-read list, in order to make the results even more specific.

The app is made with the following tools and frameworks:
- Node.js (Express)
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Pug
- Sass
- Css
- Bootstrap
- CSV/Json
- PostgreSQL (Sequelize)
